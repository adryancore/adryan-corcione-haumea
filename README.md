# adryan-corcione-haumea
portfolio project for Intro to Programming course with Code the Dream

Welcome to my online portfolio! This project showcases my journey as a journalist and content marketer transitioning into the world of web development. As someone who learned HTML and CSS during the Myspace era, I've come full circle, now diving deep into JavaScript through a coding bootcamp with Code the Dream.

In addition to this portfolio project, I've created: [My Open API Project](https://github.com/adryancore/api-project) 

## Getting Started
